# DoConnect

DoConnect is an imageboard style website that allows users to post questions, post answers, and upload images. When users post a question or an answer, all admins receive an email about its details and must approve it before it goes public. Admins can remove pending questions or pending answers. DoConnect allows users to use a keyword search function to parse through the question database. In DoConnect, all users can interact via chat messages.
